        <h2>Relax</h2>
        <p>Relaxation reduces stress and the symptoms of mental health conditions like depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. Relaxation also has other related health benefits, including: lowering your heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate. reducing muscle tension and chronic pain. Here are some tips to make your stress release:</p>
</div>
    <div class="get_peace">
        <p><b>Get some peace and quiet before bed</b></p>
        <img src="hha_images/peace.png" class="eighty_div_img" title="https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/getty_542959856_2000133320009280405_365308.jpg" alt="img not found">
        <p>Turn off all electronics before bed. This includes the TV, your phone, your tablet, and any other bright screen that might distract you. Peace and quiet before bed is extremely important, as it gives you time to clear your head and focus solely on relaxing and hitting the hay. Plus, those bright screens in a dark room aren't the best for your eyes, either!</p>
    </div>
    <a id="link7">
    <div class="nutrient_dense_food">
        <p><b>Eat nutrient dense food - especially before bed</b></p>

    </a>
        <p>It's always important to keep up with a healthy diet of nutrient dense foods such as fruits and vegetables, but it's especially important to practice this when you decide on a bedtime snack. If you're craving something to munch on before bed, reach for the cherries and bananas. Cherries contain natural melatonin, a hormone found in the body that promotes sleep. Bananas contain healthy amounts of potassium and magnesium, both of which naturally relax you. Berries are also a good choice because of their high levels of antioxidants that have been shown to improve sleep quality.</p>

        <p>A warm drink during the day is always refreshing, but it's even better at night when you're winding down and getting ready for bed. To help improve your sleep, we suggest a nice cup of warm, herbal tea before bed or right after dinner. There are a ton of teas out there that promote better sleep quality, but our personal favorites are chamomile tea and lavender tea - both of which you are sure to find at a local supermarket.</p>

        <p>Calming ocean waves, a cascading waterfall, a crackling bonfire, a light thunderstorm - these peaceful sounds are sure to calm you and assist you in ending and beginning your day in the most tranquil way possible. Experts agree that listening to the calming sounds of nature or steady white noise can quiet an overactive mind and put the body at ease. Our natural sound alarm clocks and sound therapy systems will help you fall asleep and wake up to these soothing sounds, all while reducing stress and clearing your mind.</p>

        <p class="text_ident">We've covered a lot of tips related to reducing stress through better sleep - but what about things you can do during the day to help you relax? Here's an idea - discover a new hobby that you enjoy and can dive into during your lunch break or after work! </p>
            <p class="text_ident">Maybe it's something you've always wanted to try like drawing or blogging, or maybe it's something you've been putting off but are still passionate about, like working out or baking treats. Whatever it is, make sure you enjoy it. A hobby shouldn't feel like a daily task you force yourself to do; it should feel relaxing and calming, and afterwards you should feel a sense of accomplishment and joy.</p>

        <p class="text_ident">It's super important to keep your home neat and organized. Clutter and heaps of dirty clothes and dishes is known to cause stress whether you see the connection or not. Your home is your sanctuary. It's the place you come to after a stressful day to relax, kick back, and enjoy your favorite book or television show.</p>
        <p class="text_ident">It's difficult to truly relax and unwind when you come home to a mess. Simply keep up with the cleaning because a cluttered home causes an unclear headspace! You may also want to consider adding some stress relieving decor to your living space, like a soothing indoor water fountain or a calming indoor fireplace!

        <p>There's a lot you can learn from your own journal when you dedicate time daily to write down your thoughts and emotions. Perhaps one day you tried a new food at lunch and it made you a little woozy, or you drank something before bed last week that made you restless. If these kinds of activities are documented, you might just find your very own stress triggers and be able to look back and cut that certain food, drink, or activity out of your life that caused you stress or discomfort.</p>

        <p>It's in our human nature to crave quality time and affection from those we love. Whether we enjoy a cup of coffee with friends, a movie with family, or snuggles with our pet, let's all make an effort to make time for it! Seriously, make time for those you love and really live in the moment with them when you're together. Put away those pesky phones, make eye contact, listen, and enjoy. You might be surprised how these moments and relationships can truly cheer you up and make that stress fizzle away.</p>

        <p>Fishing puts you outside, near a body of water, and it rewards patience. All of those are good things. Better still, grab a young niece or nephew or grandchild, and teach them how to fish. Even if you don’t catch (and release) anything, you’ll both forge a treasured, lifelong memory. With a little luck, you reel in a perch that will grow into a marlin after multiple retellings of the story at family events.</p>

        <p class="text_ident">Walking is good for you, but not all walks are created equal. Cruising the urban streets doesn’t provide the same mental boost as hiking a local trail or feeling the sandy beach between your toes. You don’t have to have a specific destination in mind, either – your goal isn’t to hike a particular number of miles, but to aimlessly immerse yourself in the natural world around you. The Japanese call this “forest bathing” and it can rejuvenate a weary mind.</p>
        <p class="text_ident">We need breaks. And not just as temporary escapes from the pressures of work. Done properly, breaks can reduce mental fatigue, boost brain function and creativity, and actually keep us on-task for longer periods of time. Ironically, the more time we take off, the more we’re able to work.</p>

        <p>Rest is vital for better mental health, increased concentration and memory, a healthier immune system, reduced stress, improved mood and even a better metabolism.
So many people are caught in the grind of work, family responsibilities and ongoing stress. Often, we only allow ourselves to truly rest on holidays or vacation. However, it’s so important to prioritize adequate rest and quality sleep in your everyday life. Rest and sleep are two different things, but both are equally important to your mental, emotional and physical health. Plus, prioritizing rest can actually improve your quality of sleep.

        <p>In addition to daily rest and relaxation, it’s recommended that adults get seven to eight hours of sleep each night, but quality is just as important as quantity. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is the most restorative of the five sleep cycles. At least one-quarter of your sleep should be spent in the REM cycle.
            <br>How can you ensure that you get enough quality sleep each night? Here are a few tips.
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening.</li>
                <li>Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, even on the weekends.
</li>
                <li>Set your thermostat between 60 and 70 degrees at night.</li>
                <li>Avoid napping during the day.</li>
                <li>At least one hour before bed, swap screen time for a relaxing activity such as reading, bedtime yoga or a relaxing bath.</li>
                <li>Exercise is important, but avoid working out late in the day, if possible. </li>
            </ul></p>

        <p class="text_ident">We’ve all had those moments where time slips away and we’re in the zone for hours on end. But unfortunately, those moments of blissful flow are few and far between. Instead, to get the most out of our workday we need to treat it like a series of small battles, not an all-out war.</p>
        <p>Concentration and focus are our ultimate productivity weapons, and need to be protected. Yet they’re constantly under attack and used up resisting the ‘bad’ choices that surround us. Working in a series of short bursts or ‘sprints’ followed by short breaks are the best ways to keep yourself on track.
            <ul>
                <li>By knowing you have a break coming up, you’re more likely to stay focused and work with purpose.</li>
                <li>Working for any longer can cause cognitive boredom. Beyond 52 minutes of working your mind starts to wander and can have longer-term negative effects by causing you to be less engaged with the task at hand.</li>
                <li>Your body wasn’t meant to sit for 8-hours a day. You’re probably heard that sitting is the new smoking, and while the statement makes for better headlines than fact, it’s true that getting some activity at regular intervals in your day will improve your health and mental focus.

    <div class="Recharge_your_Focus">
        <p><b>Distract Yourself to Recharge your Focus</b></p>
        <p>The hardest part about taking regular breaks during your workday is that it can be incredibly hard to ‘switch off’. After spending 50+ minutes working intensely on a task, it’s more than natural to continue thinking about it during your break.</p>
        <img src="hha_images/distract_yourself.png" alt="img not found" class="eighty_div_img" title="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/02/16/10/52/beverage-3157395__340.jpg">
    </a>
        <p>Think about how you don’t really register the feeling of clothing on your body. Or how sounds that kept you awake when you first moved into your home don’t bother you anymore. The body becomes habituated to the feeling and what once grabbed our attention no longer registers in any meaningful way in the brain. The same thing happens to our thoughts.</p>
        <p>Instead of thinking about the problem without stopping, we need to create distractions that take our attention away from the task at hand so we can come back at it with a fresh mind.
One way to do this is to overload your cognitive abilities by multi-tasking on your break. It might seem counterintuitive to add more cognitive strain during a break, but the key here is to force your mind off the work at hand.

    </a>
        <p class="text_ident">One good way to make more time for enjoying the outdoors is to do something you usually do inside outside. If you make time each day to read, bring your book outside. Have your morning coffee on your deck or patio. Even mundane tasks like writing a grocery list or replying to texts and emails can be done as easily outdoors as indoors. </p>
        <p class="text_ident">It's also important to remember that your time outside doesn't have to be part of a daily fitness or exercise routine. It's OK to simply enjoy time outside doing nothing more than just relaxing. One good way to get started with outdoor relaxation is the practice of forest bathing. The idea of forest bathing is to simply be in the forest, connecting to nature with all your senses, Time(Opens in a new window) reports. You don't have to exercise or be engaged in any other activity. It's intended to be a simple and easy way to reap the benefits of time spent in nature in a world where most people spend most of their time far from it.</p>
